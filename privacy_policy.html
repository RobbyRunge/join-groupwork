            <h2 id="m2427">Relevant Legal Bases</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Relevant Legal Bases under the GDPR:</strong> Below, you will find an overview of the legal bases under the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that, in addition to the GDPR, national data protection
              regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or establishment. Should more specific legal bases be relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)</strong> – The data subject has given consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Contract performance and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR)</strong> – Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for taking steps at the request of
                the data subject prior to entering into a contract.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong> – Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the
                interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>National Data Protection Regulations in Germany:</strong> In addition to the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in Germany. These include, in particular, the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG). The BDSG
              contains specific provisions on the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, and the transmission of data, as well as
              automated decision-making, including profiling. Furthermore, state data protection laws of individual federal states may apply.
            </p>

            <h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
            <p>
              In accordance with legal requirements and taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of risks to
              the rights and freedoms of natural persons, we implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.
            </p>
            <p>
              These measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data, as well as access, input, transfer, availability, and
              separation of data. Additionally, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subject rights, data deletion, and responses to data breaches. We also consider the protection of personal data during the
              development and selection of hardware, software, and processes, in accordance with the principles of data protection by design and by default.
            </p>
            <p>
              Securing Online Connections with TLS/SSL Encryption (HTTPS): To protect user data transmitted through our online services from unauthorized access, we use TLS/SSL encryption technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport
              Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of secure data transmission on the internet. These technologies encrypt information transmitted between the website or app and the user's browser (or between two servers), ensuring
              that data is protected from unauthorized access. TLS, as the more advanced and secure version of SSL, ensures that all data transmissions meet the highest security standards. When a website is secured by an SSL/TLS
              certificate, this is indicated by the display of HTTPS in the URL. This serves as an indicator to users that their data is being transmitted securely and encrypted.
            </p>

            <h2 id="m25">Transfer of Personal Data</h2>
            <p>
              In the course of our processing of personal data, it may be necessary to transmit or disclose such data to other entities, companies, legally independent organizational units, or individuals. Recipients of this data may
              include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content integrated into a website. In such cases, we comply with legal requirements and, in particular, conclude appropriate
              contracts or agreements with the recipients of your data to ensure the protection of your data.
            </p>

            <h2 id="m24">International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>
              Data Processing in Third Countries: If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if processing occurs in the context of using third-party services or
              disclosing or transferring data to other individuals, entities, or companies, this is done only in accordance with legal requirements. If the level of data protection in the third country has been recognized by an adequacy
              decision (Art. 45 GDPR), this serves as the basis for data transfer. Otherwise, data transfers occur only if the level of data protection is otherwise ensured, particularly through standard contractual clauses (Art. 46(2)(c)
              GDPR), explicit consent, or in the case of contractual or legally required transmission (Art. 49(1) GDPR). We will inform you of the bases for third-country transfers for individual providers from third countries, with
              adequacy decisions taking precedence. Information on third-country transfers and existing adequacy decisions can be found on the European Commission's website:
              <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=de" target="_blank"
                >https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=de.</a
              >
              Under the so-called "Data Privacy Framework" (DPF), the European Commission has also recognized the level of data protection as adequate for certain companies in the U.S. under the adequacy decision of July 10, 2023. The list
              of certified companies and further information on the DPF can be found on the U.S. Department of Commerce's website:
              <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/" target="_blank">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/</a> (in English). We will inform you within the privacy notices which service providers we use are certified under the Data
              Privacy Framework.
            </p>

            <h2 id="m12">General Information on Data Storage and Deletion</h2>
            <p>
              We delete personal data that we process in accordance with legal requirements as soon as the underlying consents are revoked or no further legal basis for processing exists. This applies to cases where the original purpose of
              processing no longer applies or the data is no longer needed. Exceptions to this rule exist if legal obligations or special interests require longer retention or archiving of the data.
            </p>
            <p>
              In particular, data that must be retained for commercial or tax law reasons or whose storage is necessary for the enforcement of legal claims or the protection of the rights of other natural or legal persons must be archived
              accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>Our privacy notices contain additional information on the retention and deletion of data that applies specifically to certain processing activities.</p>
            <p>If multiple retention periods or deletion deadlines apply to a piece of data, the longest period always takes precedence.</p>
            <p>
              If a period does not explicitly start on a specific date and lasts at least one year, it automatically begins at the end of the calendar year in which the triggering event occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual
              relationships, under which data is stored, the triggering event is the effective date of termination or other cessation of the legal relationship.
            </p>
            <p>Data that is no longer needed for the original purpose but is retained due to legal requirements or other reasons is processed exclusively for the reasons justifying its retention.</p>

            <h2 id="m134">Use of Cookies</h2>
            <p>
              The term "cookies" refers to functions that store and read information on users' devices. Cookies can be used for various purposes, such as ensuring the functionality, security, and convenience of online services, as well as
              analyzing visitor traffic. We use cookies in accordance with legal requirements. If necessary, we obtain user consent in advance. If consent is not required, we rely on our legitimate interests. This applies when storing and
              reading information is essential to provide explicitly requested content and functions. This includes, for example, storing settings and ensuring the functionality and security of our Online Offer. Consent can be revoked at
              any time. We clearly inform users about the scope and types of cookies used.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Notes on Legal Bases for Data Protection:</strong> Whether we process personal data using cookies depends on consent. If consent is given, it serves as the legal basis. Without consent, we rely on our legitimate
              interests, as explained in this section and in the context of the respective services and procedures.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Storage Duration:</strong> The following types of cookies are distinguished based on storage duration:</p>

                website. Similarly, user data collected through cookies can be used for reach measurement. If we do not provide users with explicit information on the type and storage duration of cookies (e.g., when obtaining consent), they
                should assume that these are permanent and that the storage duration can be up to two years.

                <strong>Processing of Cookie Data Based on Consent:</strong> We use a consent management solution to obtain user consent for the use of cookies or the procedures and providers mentioned in the context of the consent
                management solution. This procedure serves to obtain, log, manage, and withdraw consent, particularly regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies used to store, read, and process information on users' devices.
                Within this procedure, user consent is obtained for the use of cookies and the associated processing of information, including the specific processing and providers mentioned in the consent management process. Users also
                have the option to manage and withdraw their consent. Consent declarations are stored to avoid repeated queries and to provide proof of consent in accordance with legal requirements. Storage occurs server-side and/or in a
                cookie (so-called opt-in cookie) or through similar technologies to assign consent to a specific user or their device. If no specific information is provided on the providers of consent management services, the following
                general notes apply: The storage duration of consent is up to two years. A pseudonymous user identifier is created, which is stored together with the time of consent, the scope of consent (e.g., concerning categories of
                cookies and/or service providers), and information about the browser, system, and device used;

            <ul class="glossary">
              <li>
                <strong>Inventory data:</strong> Inventory data includes essential information necessary for the identification and management of contractual partners, user accounts, profiles, and similar assignments. This data may include
                personal and demographic information such as names, contact information (addresses, phone numbers, email addresses), dates of birth, and specific identifiers (user IDs). Inventory data forms the basis for any formal
                interaction between individuals and services, facilities, or systems by enabling unique assignment and communication.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Content data:</strong> Content data includes information generated during the creation, editing, and publication of content of any kind. This category of data may include texts, images, videos, audio files, and other
                multimedia content published on various platforms and media. Content data is not limited to the actual content but also includes metadata that provides information about the content itself, such as tags, descriptions,
                authorship information, and publication dates.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Contact data:</strong> Contact data includes essential information that enables communication with individuals or organizations. This includes, among other things, phone numbers, postal addresses, and email
                addresses, as well as communication means such as social media handles and instant messaging identifiers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Meta, communication, and procedural data:</strong> Meta, communication, and procedural data are categories that contain information about how data is processed, transmitted, and managed. Metadata, also known as data
                about data, includes information that describes the context, origin, and structure of other data. It may include details such as file size, creation date, document author, and change histories. Communication data captures
                the exchange of information between users through various channels, such as email traffic, call logs, messages on social networks, and chat histories, including the involved parties, timestamps, and transmission paths.
                Procedural data describes the processes and workflows within systems or organizations, including workflow documentation, transaction logs, and audit logs used for tracking and verifying activities.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Usage data:</strong> Usage data refers to information that captures how users interact with digital products, services, or platforms. This data includes a wide range of information that shows how users use
                applications, which features they prefer, how long they stay on certain pages, and through which paths they navigate through an application. Usage data may also include frequency of use, timestamps of activities, IP
                addresses, device information, and location data. It is particularly valuable for analyzing user behavior, optimizing user experiences, personalizing content, and improving products or services. Furthermore, usage data plays
                a crucial role in identifying trends, preferences, and potential problem areas within digital offerings.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Personal data:</strong> "Personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or
                indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier (e.g., a cookie), or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological,
                genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Log data:</strong> Log data is information about events or activities logged in a system or network. This data typically includes information such as timestamps, IP addresses, user actions, error messages, and other
                details about the use or operation of a system. Log data is often used for analyzing system issues, security monitoring, or generating performance reports.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Controller:</strong> The "controller" is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Processing:</strong> "Processing" means any operation or set of operations performed on personal data, whether or not by automated means. The term is broad and covers virtually any handling of data, including
                collection, analysis, storage, transmission, or deletion.
